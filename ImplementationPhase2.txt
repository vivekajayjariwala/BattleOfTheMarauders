Implementation Phase Report for The Battle of the Marauders - Version 2
We have outlined a tentative plan for implementing The Battle of the Marauders, which will be developed using Python and Pygame. The plan is divided into three phases, and each phase has a set of tasks that need to be completed. We have assigned responsibilities to each team member based on their expertise.

Phase 1: Framework Development

Responsibilities:

Vivek Jariwala: Create the title screen and design the sprites for the characters using Pixilart.com - COMPLETED 
Jeffano John: Implement the character creation screen and map system. - COMPLETED 1/2 (character selection is done, map is in progress)
Aahash Srikumar: Implement the game's combat system and design the different moves/abilities of each character. - IN PROGRESS
Ahmed Elghandour: Develop the programs for storing character information, equipment, and items. - IN PROGRESS

Phase 2: Content Creation

Responsibilities:

Vivek Jariwala: Focus on developing the battle for enemies #1 and #2. 
Jeffano John: focus on developing the battle for enemies #3 and #4.
Aahash Srikumar: Implement enemy AI and design the game's combat animations and effects.
+ From Phase 1: Implement the game's combat system and design the different moves/abilities of each character.
Ahmed Elghandour: Implement the shop feature of the game that allows players to upgrade their abilities/weapons. 
+ From Phase 1: Develop the programs for storing character information, equipment, and items. 

Phase 3: Testing and Polish

Responsibilities:

Vivek Jariwala: Test the game's mechanics and optimize the game's performance.
Jeffano John: Conduct user testing and collect feedback to improve the game's usability and design.
Aahash Srikumar: Balance the game's difficulty and refine the combat system based on user feedback.
Ahmed Elghandour: Bug-fixing and final polish of the game.

By following this plan, we believe we can successfully implement The Battle of the Marauders using Python and Pygame.
